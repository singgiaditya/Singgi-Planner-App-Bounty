**Widget Write-up: Weather, Stopwatch, and Todo List**

**Weather Widget:**
The Weather Widget is an essential component in a planner app as it provides users with up-to-date weather information. Users can easily check the current weather conditions, temperature, and additional details like humidity, wind speed, and precipitation. This widget allows users to plan their day effectively by considering weather forecasts.

To use the Weather Widget, it automatically detects the user's location or allows manual input of a specific location. The widget fetches data from a weather API and displays the relevant information in a visually appealing format. Users can quickly glance at the widget to get an overview of the weather and plan their activities accordingly.

**Stopwatch Widget:**
The Stopwatch Widget is a valuable addition to the planner app, especially for users who need to track time accurately. Whether it's timing tasks, workouts, or projects, the Stopwatch Widget provides a reliable and convenient solution.

To use the Stopwatch Widget, users can start, stop, and reset the stopwatch with simple buttons. The widget displays the elapsed time in milliseconds, allowing precise measurement. Users can utilize the stopwatch for time-sensitive activities, manage their time effectively, and improve productivity.

**Todo List Widget:**
The Todo List Widget is a fundamental tool for organizing tasks and ensuring productivity. It allows users to create a list of tasks, mark them as completed, and keep track of pending and completed items.

To use the Todo List Widget, users can enter tasks into the input field and click the "Add" button to add them to the list. Each task appears with options to mark it as complete or delete it. The widget conveniently separates pending and completed tasks, enabling users to focus on what needs to be done. Users can easily manage their tasks, track progress, and prioritize their workflow effectively.

These three custom-made widgets, Weather, Stopwatch, and Todo List, enhance the planner app's functionality and provide users with valuable tools for better planning, time management, and task organization.
